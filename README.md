# leaflet-mapping


## Purpose
An interactive dashboard provides infomation on earthquakes that have occurred in the last month around the world. The user can select different map backgrounds, and tectonic lines are visible as well.

## Tools
The leaflet and D3 libraries for JavaScript are used to read the geoJSON and  display the data in a map format. Earthquake data comes from [The USGS](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php), and the user can change the input to alter the scope of the earthquake data. The geocoordinates for the tectonic plate data comes from (Github user @fraxen)[https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates]. The .css file formats the appearance of the map and legend, while the .html file sturctures the page and implements the tools necessary for the dashboard to execute properly. 

## Results
The dashboard can be viewed (here)[https://robotscott94.github.io/leaflet-mapping/].
